# Bachelor Thesis

This repository contains various Python scripts developed for data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling as part of my bachelor thesis.

## Contents

### 1. AR_data_analysis.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook includes:
- Generation and analysis of Autoregressive (AR) processes.
- Visualization of unit roots and characteristic polynomials.
- Application of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for stationarity.

### 2. helper.py
This script provides utility functions for:
- Generating AR, MA, and ARMA processes.
- Manually simulating AR and MA processes.
- Plotting unit roots of the characteristic polynomial.

### 3. data_analysis.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook includes:
- Downloading and analyzing historical market data using `yfinance`.
- Calculating and visualizing daily returns.
- Plotting Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF).

## Installation

To run the scripts and notebooks, you need to have Python installed along with the following packages:

You can install the required packages using pip:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
